Due to a bug in early implementations of Bitcoin, the 50 BTC output created in the genesis block was not added to the UTXO set. As a result, it can never be spent and does not add to the supply of BTC. Fixing this would result in a hardfork, and has been deemed an unnecessary change.

This transation is also notable for containing Satoshi's famous message and timestamp to the real-world.

The `coinbase` value can be converted back to the message as follows:

```
echo "04ffff001d0104455468652054696d65732030332f4a616e2f32303039204368616e63656c6c6f72206f6e206272696e6b206f66207365636f6e64206261696c6f757420666f722062616e6b73" | cut -c17- | xxd -r -p
```

Giving us the famous:

```
The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
