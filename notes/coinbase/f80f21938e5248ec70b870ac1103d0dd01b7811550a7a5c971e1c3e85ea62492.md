### Coinbase Reward Loss

For a variety of reasons, some blocks do not claim their full block reward.

The Bitcoin Protocol and reference Bitcoin Core implementation only require that the sum of all outputs in the coinbase transaction are less than or equal to `block subsidy + transaction fees` for that block. They don't require that all of this entitlement is claimed by the miner.

Over the years, numerous misconfigurations and bugs in the systems used by miners to generate block templates have resulted in under-claiming of the block reward. Not only is this a loss to the miner, but it also reduces the total supply of Bitcoin that will ever be mined. There is no mechanism to claim unclaimed rewards after the block in which they were supposed to be claimed.

On rarer occasions, bugs in the reference implementation itself have led to losses - notably, the [Genesis Block](https://burned.money/block/0), [Block 91722](https://burned.money/block/91722), and [Block 91812](https://burned.money/block/91812) block rewards were claimed but destroyed due to bugs in the Bitcoin Core implementation at that time.
