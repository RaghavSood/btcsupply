### Block 124724 - Mining Subsidy Loss

After block 124724 was mined with a subsidy 0.01000001 less than the permitted 50 BTC block subsidy + 0.01 BTC in fees, bitcointalk user `midnightmagic` claimed[^1] it was semi-intentional.

As per the post, the intention was to claim 1 satoshi less than the permitted subsidy, as a nod to Satoshi's departure from public view. This would result in Bitcoin's supply permanently missing a Satoshi, just like the world was missing Satoshi Nakamoto.

However, the script used to generate the block also forgoed the fees, resulting in a 0.01000001 BTC loss.
