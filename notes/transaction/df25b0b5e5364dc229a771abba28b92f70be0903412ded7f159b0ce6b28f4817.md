### Identical Coinbase Transaction Bug

In the early days of Bitcoin, it was assumed that two different transactions would never have the same hash, or transaction ID. This was a fair assumption on the surface, as each transaction consumes unique inputs, and the hash of a transaction was based on the contents of the transaction. However, this overlooked the fact that Coinbase transactions had no prior inputs, and the coinbase field was entirely determined by the miner.

In 2010, this was demonstrated accidentally twice in quick succession. Blocks [91722](https://burned.money/block/91722) and 91880 both sent the 50 BTC block subsidy to the same public key. Both blocks charged no fees, and used an identical coinbase field of `0456720e1b00`. Simultaneously, blocks [91812](https://burned.money/block/91812) and 91842 used a different public key, but had the same coinbase field of `0456720e1b00`.

This resulted in two instances of identical coinbase transactions, which resulted in them having identical transaction IDs: 

1. [e3bf3d07d4b0375638d5f1db5255fe07ba2c4cb067cd81b84ee974b6585fb468](https://burned.money/transaction/e3bf3d07d4b0375638d5f1db5255fe07ba2c4cb067cd81b84ee974b6585fb468) - Blocks 91722 and 91880
2. [d5d27987d2a3dfc724e359870c6644b40e497bdc0589a033220fe15429d88599](https://burned.money/transaction/d5d27987d2a3dfc724e359870c6644b40e497bdc0589a033220fe15429d88599) - Blocks 91812 and 91842

With the Bitcoin Core implementation at the time, this caused the second blocks containing each duplicate transaction to effectively "overwrite" the previous one, resulting in a loss of 50 BTC each time. This effectively reduced the value of the UTXO set by 100 BTC, thereby permanently reducing the supply.

This was subsequently address in BIP30[^1] and BIP34[^2], which restricted overwriting of transactions, and ensured that each coinbase transaction contained the block height in the coinbase field, making them unique.

Unfortunately, it came too late for the miner(s) who lost 100 BTC.
