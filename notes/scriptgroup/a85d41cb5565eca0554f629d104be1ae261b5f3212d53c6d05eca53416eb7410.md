### ECDSA Incompability

The Bitcoin Protocol relies on the secp256k1 elliptic curve for its cryptographic operations. This curve belongs to the larger family of elliptic curves.

Bitcoin also employs a number of hashing operations such as SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. These operations are used in various places across the protocol, including in the creation of addresses and their corresponding Bitcoin Scripts.

In some cases, it is possible to select values that are invalid for the secp256k1 curve as inputs to the hashing operations. This can lead to unexpected results, such as the creation of addresses that can be used to receive BTC, but are never able to spend it.
