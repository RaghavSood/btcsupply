### Error Script

Error Scripts are Bitcoin Scripts that are unspendable due to an error in their construction. While Bitcoin Script is not Turing Complete[^1], it does offer a significant range of functionality over and above the common key-linked address variants such as Pay-2-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH). This flexibility can lead to errors in script construction that render the script unspendable, such as illogical operations or bad data management.
