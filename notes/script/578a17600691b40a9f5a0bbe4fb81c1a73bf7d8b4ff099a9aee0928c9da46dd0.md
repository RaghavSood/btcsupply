### Satoshi's Keys

This script received the coinbase output of Block 9, mined by Satoshi. Notably, these coins were spent in Satoshi's first transaction, which sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney, and a few subsequent transactions before becoming inactive.

Any outputs controlled by keys associated with Satoshi Nakamoto are considered lost after Satoshi's disappearance.
