### Genesis Block P2PKH Address

The address `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa` is the Pay-to-Pubkey-Hash (P2PKH) encoding of the public key used in the Genesis Block output. Although the [coinbase transaction](https://burned.money/transaction/4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b) in the the Genesis Block used the raw [public key](https://burned.money/script/4104678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5fac), explorers have often force-encoded the address to its P2PKH version. As a result, many transactions have been sent to the P2PKH encoding.

Ultimately, this address is controlled by the same private key as the public key version. As such, it is impossible for any BTC sent here to be spent without access to Satoshi's very first wallet.
