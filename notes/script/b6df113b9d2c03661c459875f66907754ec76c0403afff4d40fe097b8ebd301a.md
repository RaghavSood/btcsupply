### The Zero Public Key

All valid Bitcoin Public keys begin with `0x02` or `0x03` for compressed keys, or `0x04` for uncompressed keys. These prefixes are followed by 32 to 33 bytes of data that represent the x and y coordinates of a point on the secp256k1 elliptic curve.

However, it is possible to use an invalid public key in a Bitcoin Script, such as `0x00` followed by 64 bytes of zeros. The resulting script, when expressed as a Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) output, can be used to receive BTC but never spend it as it is impossible to produce a valid signature that will match the zero public key.
