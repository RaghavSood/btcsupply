### The 0x00 Public Key Address

The `1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh` address is a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) address that is derived from a public key that solely contains the byte `0x00`. This is the point at infinity on the secp256k1 elliptic curve, and is not a permitted public key[^1].

This results in any BTC sent to this address being irrevocably lost, as it is impossible to generate a signature that will validate against the `0x00` public key.

Over the years, a handful of bugs[^2] in wallet applications have resulted in users inadvertently sending BTC to this address.
