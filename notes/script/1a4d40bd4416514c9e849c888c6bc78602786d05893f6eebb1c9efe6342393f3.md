### Genesis Block Address (P2PK) format

`12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX` is the Pay-2-Pubkey-Hash (P2PKH) address derived from the public key of the coinbase transaction of the first block mined after the Genesis Block. This address is widely believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. 

The coinbase output was directly sent to the public key, not to a P2PKH address. Therefore, any outputs sent to the P2PKH version of this address would only be spendable if Satoshi's original wallet files are accessible and in good order. Due to the misrepresentation of this address as a P2PKH address, it has received a significant amount of funds over the years. Most of these outputs are sent to the P2PKH version of the address.
