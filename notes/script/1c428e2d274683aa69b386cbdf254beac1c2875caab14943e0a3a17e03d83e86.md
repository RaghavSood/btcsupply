### Stone Man's BTC

In August 2010, bitcointalk user `Stone Man` posted[^1] seeking help recovering lost BTC. Unfortunately, the user had made a test transaction sending his 9000 BTC to a new address within his wallet, and then restored the wallet from a previous backup.

At this point in Bitcoin History, each individual address in a wallet was backed by a private key completely unrelated to any other address in the wallet. As the wallet backup had been generated before the new address used to receive the coins had been created, the private key for the new address was not in the backup.

This effectively turned that address, `167ZWTT8n6s4ya8cGjqNNQjDwDGY31vmHg`, into a Burn Address, forever sealing in the BTC.
