### Genesis Block Address (P2PK format)

The Genesis Block's coinbase output was sent to this Pay-2-Pubkey (P2PK) address. Due to a bug in the original implementation of Bitcoin, the genesis block output was never added to the UTXO set and was unspendable. However, the public key associated with it is valid. A handful of transfers have subsequently been sent to that key, but remain unspendable until and unless Satohi's keys are found.

As with many early Bitcoin transactions, some explorers misrepresent the address by forcefully converting it to a Pay-2-Pubkey-Hash (P2PKH) address, and may display it as `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`.
