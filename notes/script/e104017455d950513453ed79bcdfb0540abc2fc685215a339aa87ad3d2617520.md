This script received the output of the first block mined after the Genesis Block - i.e. Block #1.

This is believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. It is widely assumed that he was the only miner active at the time Block #1 was mined.

Although many explorers index this address as `12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX`, it is actually a Pay-to-Pubkey (P2PK) address, with the coinbase output being directly sent to the public key.

Any outputs sent to the P2PK version of this address would only be spendable if Satohi's original wallet files are accessible and in good order.

However, due to the misrepresentation of this as a Pay-to-Pubkey-Hash (P2PKH) address, it has received a significant amount of funds over the years. Most of these outputs are sent to the P2PKH version of the address.
