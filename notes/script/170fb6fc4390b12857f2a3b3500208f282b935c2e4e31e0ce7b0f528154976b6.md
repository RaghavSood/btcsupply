### Multibit's Corrupted Blockchain.info import

In 2014, a user imported a Blockchain.info wallet into MultiBit. At the time, HD wallets were in their infancy, so each wallet was essentially a bundle of private keys.

After making a transaction, the user realized that the change output was sent to an address listed in the Multibit wallet, but the wallet did not appear to contain a private key for it[^1].

After some investigation by Mike Hearn, an early Bitcoin developer, it was discovered that during the import process, one of the keys was corrupted[^2]. It remains unknown if this was caused by a bad blockchain.info export or a bug in Multibit.
