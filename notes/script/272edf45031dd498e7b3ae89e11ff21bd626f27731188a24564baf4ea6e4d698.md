The Bitcoin Script `76a90088ac` was erroneously constructed by Mt. Gox. It decodes to:

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_0 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

It is a variant of the traditional P2PKH script, which is structured as:

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <20-byte push> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

Mt. Gox mistakenly replaced the 20-byte push with a single `0x00` byte. As `OP_HASH160` always produces a 20-byte output, this script can never evaluate to true, even if a key pair is discovered for which the public key's HASH160 evaluates to a zero-hash.
