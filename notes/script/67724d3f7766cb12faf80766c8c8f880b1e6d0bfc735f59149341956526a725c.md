### ksd5's Lost Key

On July 14th, bitcointalk user `ksd5` created a thread[^1] trying to trace BTC sent to a change address.

It emerged that while trying to test double spend protection, the user inadvertently overwrote the `wallet.dat` file containing the private key to a change address which held their 1.2 BTC balance.

While the address is not explicitly stated in the post, enough information is provided to enable us to trace the transaction and address involved[^2].
