### All Zero X and Y Coordinates

An uncompressed public key results in `0x04` followed by two blocks of all zero bytes. This is similar to the [all zero key](https://burned.money/transaction/347939105c1c90282698ef83d59d525aa5022002318949cb6c9dde271535432f), but does correctly encode the type of the key by using the `0x04` byte.

As with other such edge cases when handling zero or empty key material, it is possible to send BTC to a Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) output script that is associated with this key. However, it is not possible to spend the BTC from this output, as a signature that can be validated against this public key cannot be created.
