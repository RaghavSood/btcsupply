### All Zero X and Y Coordinates

An uncompressed public key results in `0x04` followed by two blocks of all zero bytes. This is similar to the [all zero key](https://burned.money/transaction/347939105c1c90282698ef83d59d525aa5022002318949cb6c9dde271535432f), but does correctly encode the type of the key by using the `0x04` byte.

When such a key is used to derive a Pay-to-Public-Keyhash (P2PKH) address, the resulting address is `16QaFeudRUt8NYy2yzjm3BMvG4xBbAsBFM`. While this address can be used to receive BTC, it is not possible to spend the BTC from this address, as a signature that can be validated against this public key cannot be created.
