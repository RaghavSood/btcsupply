### OP_RETURN outputs

`OP_RETURN` is a provably unspendable method that allows embedded of arbitrary data into the blockchain[^1].

`OP_RETURN` outputs are used to embed data such as messages, commitments from systems like Stacks[^2], or even files - there are no constraints on the nature of the data, only on the size per `OP_RETURN` output.

As they are provably unspendable, `OP_RETURN` outputs are pruned from the UTXO set automatically and do not contribute to the UTXO set size.

Although `OP_RETURN` outputs are exempted from the Dust Limit and can be 0-value, some users choose to transfer BTC to the output. This BTC is permanently and irreversibly lost, and reduces the circulating supply of Bitocin.
